Checkpoint #1:
?  Code compiles
*  Some or all of the palette is visible
*  Partial palette behaves when window is resized
*  All team members show repository activity

Repo Activity:
    19  Javaheri, Cameron <cameron.javaheri@mines.sdsmt.edu>
     3  Matthew Schallenkamp <matthew.schallenkamp@gmail.com>

   Concerned about the lack of balance in the repo activity.  Make sure everyone
is doing frequent commits and pushes whenever code is working.

    Default build target does not build due to missing file (doxy_config)

   Full palette visible.  Filled and non-filled rectangles can be drawn.
   Well ahead of the required development pace.  Keep it up.

   Shapes disappear when window is resized.

Checkpoint #2:
*  All requirements from Sept. 22 checkpoint (.h files not required on the compile line)
*  Full palette is displayed
?  Existing functions have function headers
*  Can select border and fill colors
*  Can draw (at least) a single shape with (above) border and fill color

Repo Activity:
    21  Javaheri, Cameron <cameron.javaheri@mines.sdsmt.edu>
    20  Matthew Schallenkamp <matthew.schallenkamp@gmail.com>

   Much better frequency, balance, overall activity in the repository.

   Function headers require parameter descriptions.  Some are missing (e.g.
Preview_Box)

   All shapes (filled and non-filled) appear to be working

   Shapes disappear when window is resized.
